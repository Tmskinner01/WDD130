            <h1>Techniques</h1>
            <p>There are so many painting techniques to learn as you continue your hobbying journey. Below are some popular techniques ranging from beginner to advanced. The great thing about these techniques is the ability to mix and match each one depending on the model. Knowing when to use each technique can bring variety and flair to your models. As you find your own painting style this skill will become second-nature.</p>

                <h3>Over-brushing</h3>
                <p>Often mistaken as dry-brushing, over-brushing is a fast and easy way to add highlights to your models. By removing most of your paint from the brush, you are able to run your brush over the mode and catch the raised edges with your highlight color. An important part of over-brushing is using a non absorbent surface, such as your paint palette to remove the paint from your brush. This keeps the application smooth and is the main difference between over-brushing and dry-brushing.</p>

                <h3>Wet Palette (Beginner)</h3>
                <p>Using a wet palette can be a useful technique for thinning and mixing your paints. The idea is to keep your paints moist while on the palette. This is usually achieved by placing a layer of parchment paper over top of a water-soaked spongy material, such as paper towel. Your paints stay usable for a longer period of time this way, and as a bonus, paint is saved in the process. Metallic paints, shaders, and paints you want to over-brush with typically work best on a dry palette. </p>

                <h3>Wet-blending (Intermediate)</h3>
                <p>Wet-blending can give you some very smooth transitions, but it takes practice. The idea is to blend your color transition on the model before the paint dries. Youâ€™ll want to thin your paints to extend the flow and drying time, and pull the colors together with your brush after they are applied to the model.</p>

                <h3>Edge Highlighting (Intermediate)</h3>
                <p> Edge highlights can really bring some flair to parts of your models, but getting them right can be tricky. The easiest way to edge highlight is to find a suitable edge, and run the side of your brush across it, allowing the paint to only contact that edge. </p>

                <h3>Non-metallic Metal (Advanced)</h3>
                <p>The goal of non-metallic metal is to simulate the light reflections of a metallic surface, without using metallic paints. This can be very difficult to do well, and requires a lot of patience, failed attempts and practice. If done effectively, the results can be stunning.

                <h3>Object-source Lighting (Advanced)</h3>
                <p>Object-source lighting is a great way to make a model stand out. The goal is to simulate light emitting from somewhere on or near the model. The key is not overdoing it. Subtle transitions on a small area of the model can go a long way. </p>
