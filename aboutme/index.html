   <h2>"The Toddfather"</h2>
   <p>I'm Todd Skinner, I'm working on my Web Design Certificate through BYU Pathway and BYU-Idaho. I hope to continue this through to an Applied Technology degree. 
    <p>I love playing unique and immersive board games. A few of my favorites right now are Root and Nemesis. I also love to paint miniature figurines for games like Warhammer 40k.</p>
    <p>My favorite standalone movie is Pacific Rim. I also love the Lord of the Rings books and movies (only the extended cuts of course). I have four brothers and three sisters. My favorite quote is "Not all those who wander are lost" </p>
